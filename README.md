# Docker with Node Js and MONGO DB
In this repository, I learned to use such technology as docker and docker-compos, 
I also first got acquainted with such technology as NGinx, in this project 6 backend services are made on node js, 
and thanks to docker-compos and nginx I connected these services to each other.
